                Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. More specifically Computer Science looks at software and software systems in hardware, not the design of hardware. Computer Science is a very wide ranging degree that opens up to many different careers. With a Computer Science degree one can program new applications, softwares, devices and create advanced algorithmic programs and databases.

                Computer Science requires knowledge of advanced mathematics to learn how to analyze and optimize efficiency. An example of this is optimizing efficiency of hardware by using the threads in cores most efficiently and dividing up the work the hardware has to do. Most optimization for hardware needs to be done through software.

                Knowledge of electrical science is needed to understand Computer Science due to the thermodynamics knowledge needed for keeping devices at maximum output. In addition one needs to acquire knowledge of how electrical transistors work to make processing units.

                I have and am interested in Computer Science because of my love for programming. I love solving problems and learning new languages that solve new problems. It is all like one massive puzzle that never ends and that can keep being optimized until a maximum efficiency is reached. Computer Science is its own artform. To create something so optimized in such a short space of time is a beautiful thing. Overall, I donâ€™t understand my love for programming and Computer Science. I just know I like programming and Computer Science Is my pathway to program for a career.
